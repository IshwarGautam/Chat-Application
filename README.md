# Chat Application

### `FrontEnd with React.js`

The application should have a login page where users can enter their credentials to login.
Once logged in, users should be able to see a list of other online users and start a chat with them.
The chat interface should display the chat history and allow users to send and receive messages in real-time.
The chat interface should also have an input field where users can type and send messages.

### `BackEnd with Nest.js`

The backend should be able to handle multiple concurrent connections.
It should provide APIs for user authentication, user status management, and real-time messaging.
Database preference is also your choice. Try to use as minimal libraries as possible.
